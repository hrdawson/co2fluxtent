  ### This function is meant to perform a linear and non-linear fitting of h2o absorpotion data from LiCOR machines to provide estimates of evapotranspiraiton.  It is modeled off of a previous function designed to perform similar fitting of co2 data to estimate net ecosystem exchange.  The nee.calc code still exists as a future step will be to integrate these two fits to be performed simultaneously (the nee.fit function assumes that h20 remains constant).  All comments from previous version/s are maintained.

  ### Transpiration is only plants when stomata are open (daytime measurements).  Evapotranspiration is everything, plants and soils (daytime measurements), and evaporation is only soils, (nighttime or dark/respiration measurements).  Thus, we are measuring, directly, only evapotranspiration (ET) and evaporation (E).  But, we can extract Transpiration as ET = E + T (see Wang et al.).  Some report T/ET ratios.  Our estimates appear reasonable with others reported by Wang et al. and Burba et al.  Do see Wang et al.'s review paper for comments on reliability of nightime measurements as proxy for evaporation.  Specifically, he quotes studies that found measurable non-zero transpiration during plant respiration.

  ## This version is from 02.
  ## This function is meant to perform the linear and non-linear fitting to nee data.  It will produce a plot of the data, queery the user if they would like to modify the time interval over which the data is fit, then print the paste statement of data values.  Currently, the function is written so that it works for a given filename.  From there, we can extend to a folder/directory.

    # Run nls() with the optimized starting values from previous nls2().  Control variable is set to prevent warnings from ending loop.  However, they will still be printed at end of run.  When this happens, it is indicative of the fact that the function parameters (A and B) are large (non-physical) for the fitting, yet still produce a fit.  This is worth further investigation.  However, it appears that the nee value produced by the exponential model in such circumstances does not deviate from the linear model by much more than half a percent.  Add a "trace = TRUE" parameter setting to the nls() function to be able to watch the values of A and B change with each iteration.  A is Css and B is tau, from Saleska et al., and to translate to variables extracted from fit further down.
    uptake.fm <- nls(wprime ~ (wnot - A)*exp(-time/B) + A, data = df, start = coef(optimize.start), control = nls.control(warnOnly = TRUE), trace = FALSE)
